  <h1>Website Critique</h1>
  <h2>Poorly Designed Websites:</h2>

<a href="https://www.spacejam.com/archive/spacejam/movie/jam.html">Welcome to the Space Jam</a>

<p>First up, Is the promotional Website for the 1996 cult classic film, Space
Jam, starring Michael Jordan. The reason this site is so hilariously awful, is
because of the cheap repeated pattern background, the tiny, ms paint looking
icons, bold, cheesy looking cartoonish fonts, and overall horrible composition
(The enormous amount of blank space on the page) of the site’s main layout. The
links on the page lead to other pages that continue to show the same problems as
the main page.</p>

<a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff/">Sweet Bro and Hella Jeff </a>

<p>Next, there is a page for the first panel of the webcomic “Sweet bro and
Hella Jeff.” The page itself is meant to be ironic, yet regardless, it is still
a prime example of terrible web design. The site itself has crusty and horribly
cut images, consistent use of Comic Sans as its primary font, horrible colors
chosen that clash with the background and focus of the page, and the site itself
is unruly and uncomfortable to navigate.</p>

  <h3>Well Designed Websites</h3>

<a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple </a>

<p>Our first example of a well designed site, is the Apple homepage. The site
does a good job of filling the space space that it needs to, in order to
showcase its products, and services to the viewer. The text is easy to read, and
supplements the large icons, which are the primary focus of the page. The links
are easy to find and navigate to look at the specific products that apple has to
offer. It is an appealing and easy to navigate site.</p>

<a href="https://www.razer.com/">Razer </a>

<p>The site for Razer, a computer gaming accessory site has a great layout,
color scheme, and composition. It is bright and colorful, which represents the
products they are trying to sell. In addition, the Razer logo is very stand out,
drawing attention as if to remind the viewer what site they are currently
visiting. It does well to use images to showcase their products as well. Despite
the site being well put together, I personally do not like the “Gamer”
Aesthetic. But that being said, it is still a good site that advertises their
products well.</p>
