    <h2>I worked alone in 3ds max to create a short 3d level using all original
      assets. (With the exception of the wall and floor textures) The character
      model, platforms, gears, music, character textures and all animations were
      done by me.</h2>

    <h2>Me and a friend worked on a short  Unity game for fun. I personally
      designed the levels, worked on music, and made the code for jumping,
      bouncing, zip lining and ground pounding. It was a great learning experience
      to try implementing platforming game mechanics in Unity code.</h2>

      <h2>I worked with a few friends to design an avian character for modelling,
        rigging and animation. Using their sketches, I was able to model this
       character, and give him original animations that you can see here.</h2>
