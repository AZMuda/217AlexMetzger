<h3>ORIGINAL MUSIC OVER VIDEO GAME CLIPS</h3>

<h2>I used clips from five very different video games and composed new music for
   each. The music was intended to reflect the theme, era, and style of each game.
    These mostly consist of short 20-30 second clips of each game accompanied by
    my own original music created in FL Studio.</h2>

    <h2>A small group of College friends and I created the sound and Foley-work
      for a scene from the video game "Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice." The clip
      was made by a professional studio, but all sounds used and voices recorded
      were made and edited in by our group. You can watch the clip and hear our
      edits here.</h2>

          <h2>I worked on transposing the opening theme "Youkoso Japari Park" from
             the Japanese Cartoon "Kemono Friends" onto a classic Gameboy using
           a writable Gameboy Cart.</h2>

               <h2>A group of friends and I were given the task to make an original
               composition out three pre-existing video game tunes. While most of
              the writing was done by our keyboard player, I helped get the ball
            rolling on our performance, and delivered a fun part on Trombone.</h2>
