ORIGINAL   MUSIC   OVER   VIDEO   GAME   CLIPS
I used clips from five very different video games and composed new music for each. The music was intended to reflect the theme, era, and style of each game. These mostly consist of short 20-30 second clips of each game accompanied by my own original music created in FL Studio.

COWBOY   BEBOP   TRIBUTE   AND   STORYBOARD   PROJECT
I wanted to challenge myself by creating a tribute to the show Cowboy Bebop, set to the track "Rain." This was done in order to practice lining up visuals with audio, work on video editing, practice audio splicing and mixing, and basic story-boarding components. You can view the finished product here.

SENUA'S   SACRIFICE   FOLEY   PROJECT
A small group of College friends and I created the sound and Foley-work for a scene from the video game "Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice." The clip was made by a professional studio, but all sounds used and voices recorded were made and edited in by our group. You can watch the clip and hear our edits here.

GALAXYBOY  TEST  LEVEL
I worked alone in 3ds max to create a short 3d level using all original assets. (With the exception of the wall and floor textures) The character model, platforms, gears, music, character textures and all animations were done by me.

ABORT  MISSION  MARS
â€‹Me and a friend worked on a short  Unity game for fun. I personally designed the levels, worked on music, and made the code for jumping, bouncing, zip lining and ground pounding. It was a great learning experience to try implementing platforming game mechanics in Unity code.
