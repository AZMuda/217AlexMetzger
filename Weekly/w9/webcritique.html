  <h1>Website Critique</h1>
  <img src="web1.png" alt="webpage1" height="50%" width="50%">
<a href="http://www.arashshirazi.co.uk/?LMCL=DJrt3H&LMCL=wpHbUw">AryShirazi</a>

<p>The first site is Ary Shirazi's site. The homepage is flashy and provides a
bar to access Shirazi's other works. The organization is clean, and is easy to
navigate.</p>

  <img src="web2.png" alt="webpage2" height="50%" width="50%">
<a href="http://www.davidshaver.net/">DavidShaver</a>

<p>David Shaver's site is simple, a bit old fashioned, but it is effective.
The top bar lists his works, his involvement and his resume and bio. The largest
complaints are the old layout of the site, and the use of unfinished games in
his portfolio.</p>

  <img src="web3.png" alt="webpage3" height="50%" width="50%">
<a href="http://www.jayvanhutten.com/">JayVanHutten</a>

<p>This website has a particularly interesting layout, the main body giving
images and text related to the page, and a bar across the bottom that has icons
for all the games that Jay has worked on. While many of these games look a
bit cheap, the layout of the site itself is excellent, with tags for the work
theyperformed for each game.</p>

  <img src="web4.png" alt="webpage4" height="50%" width="50%">
<a href="http://www.michaellevall.com/">MichaelLevall</a>

<p>This site is simple, nothing too special, but it gets the job done. It has
images for each game listed, a list of related dates, and names. Across the top
more information related to Michael's Writing Portfolio and Resume. While the
site is not very special, like David Shaver's, it is simple and effective.</p>

<img src="web5.png" alt="webpage5" height="50%" width="50%">
<a href="http://gustavdahl.net/">GustavDahl</a>

<p>While I am not a fan of the color scheme and the material being listed, the
website itself is effective in showing Gustav's work and previous experience.
That being said, the color and layout of the site reminds me of an old, outdated
 library site, the kind that has lttle style and is often navigatedaway from
 quickly.</p>
